/* Board state on disk, reached through the agent-server file API.

   Replaces the vibe-manager FastAPI service. Every call goes through the
   Canvas host's `agentServer.request`, which targets the active backend and
   attaches the session key — so there is no base URL to configure, no
   credentials to manage, and no cross-origin request to be blocked.

   Layout is documented in store/SCHEMA.md: an index.json listing workspaces,
   and one file per ticket under workspaces/<ws>/tickets/<id>/ticket.json.

   Tickets are stored per file because the browser is not the only writer —
   the automation and the manager's CLI write from the shell, where no lock
   spans the file API, and the API has no conditional upload to build a
   compare-and-swap on (a stale If-Match is accepted, not rejected). While the
   whole board was one document, any two writers collided: measured 35/40
   concurrent UI+manager writes silently lost the manager's edit, and adding
   rev/writer tokens only reduced that to 8/40 because a writer can confirm
   its own write landed without noticing it destroyed someone else's. Giving
   each ticket its own file removes the shared document, so edits to different
   tickets cannot collide at all. Documents that remain shared (index.json,
   and a ticket against itself) still carry `rev`/`writer` and go through
   `mutateDoc`. */

/* The store lives under the agent-server user's home. The file API needs
   absolute paths and does not expand "~", so the home directory is resolved
